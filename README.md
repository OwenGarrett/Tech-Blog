# Tech Blog 

Thank you for taking the time to review my tech blog. This is my first iteration of this application and I will update it based on the valuable feedback that you provide! 

I designed this application using HTML, JavaScript, Node, Express.js, CSS, Handlebars.js, and Heroku. You may click the link on this README and you may leave a comment underneath the images of my favorite games. 

Thank you again for taking the time to review this application! I will update it based off of your feedback. Thank you!
