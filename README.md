# Tech Blog 

Thank you for taking the time to review my tech blog. This is my first iteration of this application and I will update it based on the valuable feedback that you provide! 

I designed this application using HTML, JavaScript, Node, Express.js, CSS, Handlebars.js, and Heroku. You may click the link on this README and you will be taken to the deployed application in progress. The bright colors in the CSS help me differentiate the different elements and moving parts while developing projects. Plus I love bright colors! 

The application will allow users to log in/create an account if they are using the application for the first time. Then once, they have an account and have logged in, they can comment on my game list. The the user will have the ability to log out of their account.

Thank you again for taking the time to review this application! I will update it based off of your feedback. Thank you!
